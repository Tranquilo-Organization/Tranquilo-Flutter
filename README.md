# ðŸ“±  Tranquilo App Overview

This project is a mobile application developed using Flutter, aiming to assist users in managing anxiety through various features. The app provides an accessible platform for users to receive personalized support, interact with a community, and track their mental health progress. It is designed to cater to individuals dealing with anxiety, offering a range of tools to help them better understand and manage their symptoms.

## ðŸŽ¨  System Design

The app is built using the Clean Architecture pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable and testable. This architecture divides the project into three main layers:

UI Layer: Manages the UI and handles user interactions. This layer includes views and widgets.

Logic Layer: Contains state management of app using (flutter_bloc).

Data Layer: Handles data sources such as APIs. This layer includes data models and repositories.

By using Clean Architecture, the project achieves a clear separation between business logic and UI, making it scalable, testable, and easy to maintain.
